Backbone  test

The test consists in:
developing a single page app using BackboneJS. For the data, use JSONPlaceholder (http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)

Create a page where we can see a paginated list of users (data: GET http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) with the following information:
name (with a link to the user’s details page)
email
city
Create a page with the user’s details (data: GET http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/[ID]) with the following information:
name
username
email
full address
phone
website
We should be able to edit user email and websites with valid values and save the changes.
The address visualisation should be a reusable component.
Development with coffee script would be much appreciated. No need to develop CSS (you can use bootstrap for instance).
